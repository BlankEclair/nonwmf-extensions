= A Super-repository of non-Wikimedia hosted extensions =

This repository holds a number of submodules pointing to the repositories of MediaWiki extensions that are not hosted on Wikimedia's Gerrit instance.  If you want to add one, just send us a pull request.

Repositories included here will automatically be included in [https://codesearch.wmflabs.org/search/ MediaWiki code search], which is used by MediaWiki core developers when identifying usage levels during the deprecation process.
